# Hey there! 👋

My name is Didrik Wiig-Andersen and I am originally from a small city in Norway. I currently study computer science, mathematics, and statistics in the M&T program at the University of Pennsylvania. 

My next steps involve studying compression algorithms and data storage systems that make it less expensive and faster to work with large-scale visual data, particularly in medical research, where machine learning is becoming an integral part of diagnostic workflows. Hospitals now generate millions of gigabyte-scale images annually, straining storage budgets. In current practice, images are often aggressively compressed to control costs, at the expense of slow, compute-intensive retrieval and dataset construction for training machine learning models. This trade-off between storage efficiency and data accessibility is equally present in other industries that rely on large-scale visual data, such as satellite imagery and biopharmaceutical research.

Through graduate school, I will address this challenge in two ways. Building on my current research in the Digital Pathology and AI in Cancer Research Lab at Penn Medicine, I will (1) study learning-aware compression algorithms that adapt compression method to structural differences across images, eliminating the need for manual tuning in high-throughput image-capture pipelines in an effort to reduce storage requirements, and (2) design intelligent storage and retrieval systems that provide fast, tile-level access to relevant image regions through self-optimizing indexing.

I will translate my research into a venture focused on developing technologies that make it less expensive and faster to work with large-scale visual data. Long term, I wish to found a venture capital fund that channels international funds into the Nordic region to support its startup ecosystem.
